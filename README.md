# basic-request

A very basic library to request a URL and get a result.

## Why Another Request Library?

There are approximately 10000 request packages in npm. This one adds no extra dependencies,
and uses the node.js convention of `function(error, result)` without any added parameters.
No longer will you need to check the status code of the response; basic-request treats all
status codes other than 200 as errors.

As an extra, basic-request follows redirects.

## Usage

Install with npm:

    npm install basic-request

In your code just require the package:

    var request = require('basic-request');

and then use `get()` with a callback in the traditional node.js fashion:

    request.get('http://www.google.com/', function(error, body) {
        if (error) {
            console.error('Could not access Google: %s', error);
            return;
        }
        console.log('Received %s', body);
    });

That is it! No wading through responses, parsing status codes or anything else;
basic-response will do that for you. It even follows redirects!

You can see a couple of examples in [the test file](https://github.com/alexfernandez/basic-request/blob/master/test.js).

### PUT and POST

The basic-request package now supports PUT and POST methods,
and will even stringify objects into JSON for you:

    request.post('http://www.google.com/', {attribute: 'value'}, function(error, body) {
        if (error) {
            console.error('Could not access Google with POST: %s', error);
            return;
        }
        console.log('Received %s', body);
    });

and likewise with `request.put()`.

## *BLOAT ALERT*

A couple of additional features have crept in, using a second (optional) parameter `params`:

    request.get(url, params, callback);

### Retries

Pass a `retries` param to retry requests a number of times:

    request.get('http://www.google.com/', {retries: 2}, function(error, body) {
        if (error) {
            console.error('Could not access Google with retries: %s', error);
            return;
        }
        console.log('Received %s', body);
    });

### Timeout

Pass a `timeout` param to abort the query after the given number of milliseconds:

    request.get('http://www.google.com/', {timeout: 1000}, function(error, body) {
        if (error) {
            console.error('Could not access Google with retries: %s', error);
            return;
        }
        console.log('Received %s', body);
    });
