# basic-request

A very basic library to request a URL and get a result.

## Why Another Request Library?

There are approximately 10000 request packages in npm. This one adds no extra dependencies,
and uses the node.js convention of `function(error, result)` without any added parameters.
No longer will you need to check the status code of the response; basic-request treats all
status codes other than 200 as errors.

As an extra, basic-request follows redirects.

## Usage

Install with npm:

    npm install basic-request

### GET

In your code just require the package:

``` js
var request = require('basic-request');
```

and then use `get()` with a callback in the traditional node.js fashion:

```
request.get('http://httpbin.org/', function(error, body) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error('Could not access httpbin: %s', error);
    }
    console.log('Received %s', body);
    });
```

That is it! No wading through responses, parsing status codes or anything else;
basic-response will do that for you. It even follows redirects!

You can see a couple of examples in [the test file](https://github.com/alexfernandez/basic-request/blob/master/test.js).

### PUT and POST

The basic-request package now supports PUT and POST methods,
and will even stringify objects into JSON for you:

``` js
request.post('http://httpbin.org/', {attribute: 'value'}, function(error, body) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error('Could not access httpbin with POST: %s', error);
    }
    console.log('Received %s', body);
});
```

and likewise with `request.put()`.

## *BLOAT ALERT*

A couple of additional features have crept in, using a second (optional) parameter `params`:

    request.get(url, params, callback);

For post and put, it's a third (optional) parameter `params`:

    request.post(url, body, params, callback);
    request.put(url, body, params, callback);

### Retries

Pass a `retries` param to retry requests a number of times:

``` js
request.get('http://httpbin.org/', {retries: 2}, function(error, body) {
    [...]
});
```

### Timeout

Pass a `timeout` param to abort the query after the given number of milliseconds:

``` js
request.get('http://httpbin.org/', {timeout: 1000}, function(error, body) {
    [...]
});

### Headers

Pass a `headers` param object to send each key as a header:

``` js
var headers = {
    'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8',
};
request.post('http://httpbin.org/', {a: 5}, {headers: headers}, function(error, body) {
    [...]
});
```

### Agent

Pass an `agent` object to use for keep alive:

``` js
request.get('http://httpbin.org/', {agent: new AgentKeepAlive()}, function(error, body) {
    [...]
});
```

By default, no agent is used.
Consider using
[agentkeepalive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentkeepalive)
if you need persistent connections,
instead of the default agent.

### Buffer

If `params.buffer` is truthy, then a raw buffer is returned
instead of converting to string first.

## `getResponse()`

In case you want to get the response stream and parse it yourself,
basic-request since 1.2.0 supports `getResponse()`:

    request.getResponse(url, method, body, params, callback);

where `method` can be any HTTP valid method: `GET`, `POST`...
and the `callback` will have the signature `function(error, response)`.
The remaining parameters are as explained above.
`body` and `params` are still optional.
Example:

``` js
request.getResponse('http://httpbin.org/post', POST, {a: 5}, function(error, response) {
    if (error) return console.error('Could not post: %s', error);
    response.pipe(output);
});
```
